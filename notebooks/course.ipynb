    "While the statement made earlier that Algorithms + Machine Learning = A.I is not entirely true, it still is. Machine Learning has built in algorithms. The algorithms we covered earlier are the ones that process data received back from the Machine Learning part of our A.I and combine it with other data to return sane results.\n",

There are many, many of these and they can sometimes cause the Machine Learning system to be very specific in its use. One example of this would be OCR (Optical Character Recognition). We will be using this in the exercise for this section and, as you’ll see, that even though it’s processing images, it’s processing them in a very specific way to accurately identify text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides OCR, you’ll find many, many other terms floating around that can make Machine Learning seem far more complicated than it is. Terms like Deep Learning and Neural Networks are the two that will pop up most often. Deep Learning in particular can sometimes be confusing because it’s often freely interchanged with Machine Learning. Deep Learning is technically a subset of Machine Learning. Where Machine Learning relies on a fixed dataset to make decisions and those decisions will always be made against that dataset. When an incorrect decision is made, manual intervention would be required to retrain that incorrect result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning uses an initial data set to start making decisions, but has functions built in to keep improving itself. Deep Learning would be the one of the two that is most “human-like”. It’s the reason why Deep Learning is what is used when making A.Is that should have human attributes or perform human-like tasks. Siri, Alexa, Ok Google, these are all examples of Deep Learning. They teach themselves to understand your voice and accent over time.\n",
